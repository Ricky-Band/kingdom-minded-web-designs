<p>A little bit about me. Firstly I am a son to the 
  most high Living God, Jesus Christ my Saviour, then I am 
  a husband to a beautiful Godly wife, and then I am a 
  father to three beautiful children, who have a strong 
  calling on their lives.
</p>

<p>So a little about me, I am a South African born 
  Portuguese, with 20 years experiance in the aviation
  industry and over 14 years experiance in the Learning 
  & Development world within the aviation industry.
</p>

<p>The last 4 of those years I was creating and launching 
  e-Learning modules on a e-learning site called Motive Learning
  Management System, hosted by a company called Motive. I was 
  also the main System Administrator on the system and 
  the person responsible to ensure that the LMS looked and 
  stayed clean and up to date, while being in Learning 
  Development and assisting locations across the US that either
  needed assistance or that we were starting up.
</p>

<p>I am now looking for a change and dont want to be working
  for a company, no matter how big or small, but rather want 
  to work for myself and have more time with my family.
</p>

<P>I have travelled to many countries from Australia, to Hong Kong
  to Turkey (twice), to Spain and Portugal and have actually
  lived in the United States of America. I have visited roughly
  12 states and lived in the 13th one.
